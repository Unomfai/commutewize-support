# CommuteWize Support

Welcome! This page provides help resources and contact information for CommuteWize.

## Getting Started
1. Allow Location (Always or While Using) so commute times are accurate.
2. Enable Notifications for alarms and reminders.
3. Add your Work Profile and routine in the app.

## FAQs
- **Alarms didn’t fire**: Ensure Focus/Do Not Disturb isn’t silencing alarms and that Notifications are allowed for CommuteWize (Settings → Notifications → CommuteWize).
- **Commute times seem off**: Enable Precise Location and Background App Refresh; confirm your route/destination.
- **Widget not updating**: Open the app once to refresh background data; confirm Background App Refresh is on.

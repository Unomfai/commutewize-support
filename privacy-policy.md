# CommuteWize Privacy Policy

Effective Date: August 22, 2025

CommuteWize (“we”, “our”, “us”) is a privacy‑first commute and smart alarm app. This policy explains what data we handle and how we protect it.

## Data We Collect and Why
- **Location (precise, foreground/background)**: Used to calculate travel time and adjust alarms and reminders. Without location, commute estimates may be inaccurate.
- **Notifications token**: Used by the system to deliver local notifications/alarms on your device.
- **Diagnostics (crash logs)**: Provided by Apple to help improve reliability. We do not attempt to identify users from crash data.

We do **not** collect contact information, account credentials, financial data, or advertising identifiers. We do **not** use third‑party analytics or advertising SDKs.

## How We Use Data
- Provide core features: traffic‑aware alarms, commute estimates, and reminders
- Maintain app reliability and safety (e.g., crash diagnostics)

We do **not** sell your data, and we do **not** use your data for cross‑app tracking or targeted advertising.

## Data Storage and Retention
Most data (profiles, routines, preferences) is stored **locally on your device**. Delete the app to remove local data. Crash logs, if any, are retained by Apple per their policies.

## Sharing of Data
We do not share your data with third parties. CommuteWize uses Apple Maps to request route/traffic estimates subject to Apple’s terms.

## Your Choices
- You can disable Location or adjust precision at any time in iOS Settings.
- You can disable Notifications in iOS Settings.
- You can delete the app to remove on‑device data.

## Children’s Privacy
CommuteWize is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy as the app evolves. We will update the “Effective Date” above and publish changes at this URL.
